## Why are we here?
> To get better at teaching workshops


## Start with the end in mind
> Goal of workshops
- teach something --> start with learning goals
- be more interesting than the normal classroom
- have something to share at the end of it (stories, projects, product)

## General workflow for workshops
> Designing Workshops
- **Define Purpose and Audience**: 
	- Establish learning goals + logistics from stakeholders
- **Brainstorm Topics**: 
	- Determine what specific topics / skills to teach
- **Plan**: Find appropriate activity(ies)
- **Develop**: 
	- Create material to support activity


## General flow in the workshop
> Lecturing math: grade level in school = time in minutes for attention up to 10min
- (1-3 min) Intro: 
	- interest development (value, knowledge, belonging)
- (5 min) Core Content: 
	- main concepts or skills introduction
- (35 min) Activity session
- (5 min) Reflection and Discussion
