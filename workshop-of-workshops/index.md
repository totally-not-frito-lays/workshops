## Why are we here?
> To get better at teaching workshops

## Start with the end in mind
Goal of workshops?
- [ ] teach something --> start with learning goals
- [ ] be more interesting than the normal classroom
- [ ] have something to share at the end of it (stories, projects, product)

## General workflow for workshops
> Designing Workshops
1. **Define Purpose and Audience**: Establish learning goals + logistics from stakeholders
2. **Brainstorm Topics**: Determine what specific topics / skills to teach
3. Find appropriate activity(ies)
4. **Develop**: Create material to support activity

## General flow in the workshop
> Lecturing math: grade level in school = time in minutes for attention up to 10min
1. (1-3 min) Intro: interest development (value, knowledge, belonging)
2. (5 min) Core Content: main concepts or skills introduction
3. (35 min) Activity session
4. (5 min) Reflection and Discussion

## Activity types
- Unplugged: no computer, embody the concept
- Fix: Fill in the code to create cookie cutter projects (~)
- Remix: Create variations of a base project (~TritonHacks starter kits)
- Optimize: Change parameters to tune the project in a particular way (~Genetic Algorithms)

## Resources in the classroom
- Teacher: guidance on getting class attention
- Other students: small group / pairs can self-correct on task
- Volunteers: facilitating small group dynamics / tutoring
- Worksheets: guiding exploration
