  - testing
- Competition time
- Clean-up

General Notes:
- Students will be paired in teams of 2 to form a robot team
  - teams will be paired together to form an alliance for team competitions[^5]
- Students will be referred to as athletes at the camp
- Changing small parts of the robot is expected
- Each team has medals to give out for some reason, the robots amass these medals
  - stickers or medals or flag decorations

## Schedule

### Day 01 - Robot Soccer / Rocket League

Learning Objective:
- Create a methodoical build system
- Establish ground rules for shared play
- Create the soccer arena

Student Challenge:
- Build the drive base
- Accurately "push" the ball around
- Carefully "steal possession" of the ball

Prepped Materials:
- Soccer ball x 1
- Goal lines
  - tape / box
- Out of bounds fence
  - wood planks / tape / walls / movable cabinets

Agenda:
1. (10min) Ice breaker - Intra-National Flag Design
2. (05min) Opening Ceremony
3. (05min) Rules for playing in Olympics
4. (60min) Building robot
5. (30min) Soccer matches
6. (10min) Award Ceremony + Clean-up

#### Flag Design[^2]

Materials:
  - (students x 2) A4 paper
  - (students x 1) Tape
  - (students x 1) Colored markers

Description:
  A core theme of the Olympics is healthy nationalism and sportsmanship. Since
  we want students to feel a sense of belonging, we're going to let them express
  their current identity through art so that they can display their flag on 
  their robot.

  Flags will be used to identify their robot kit. Flags should be expected to
  be attached to the robot in some form.

  Flags belong to the robots because they're the athletes. Imagine what country 
  the robot is representing. ie. cat robot

  The students are roleplaying as contracted engineers. Although they may work
  together on a robot in one day, they may be working with a different engineer
  the next day.

  We can make two copies of the flag. One copy is a large copy that they can 
  parade around (is used to identify where the robot materials are) and the 
  other copy is a smaller flag used to ID the robot itself in the field.

#### Opening Ceremony

Materials:
- Olympics theme song

Description:
  Have the athletes parade around as a pair waving their flags around the room.
  Welcome everybody to the 1st ever Monarch Robo-Olympics!

  At the end of the parade, we all sit down, one group stays up and explains
  what the flag represents.

#### General summer camp rules

Materials:
- Athlete contract
- Marker

Rules:
- "Gracious Professionalism"
  - competing while being respectful
- Don't break your robot or somebody else's robot
- Only run robots on the floor, not on the tables
- Don't touch the robots while they're on

Description
  Students should sign a group contract (like on a whiteboard or large paper).

#### Building robot

Materials:
- 2 students per table
- 1 VEX v5 robot claw bot kit

Description:
  Students build their robot carefully, making sure to follow the specs as 
  closely as possible. Teams that finish sooner will get to test their robot
  at the soccer range.

#### Soccer matches

Materials:
- Soccer ball x 1
- Goal lines
  - tape / box
- Out of bounds fence
  - wood planks / tape / walls / movable cabinets

Description:
  2 minutes per game -> overtime first to score. 1 minute for setup.

#### Award ceremony

Materials:
- laser engraved medals?
- stickers of medals?

Description:
  Students should be role playing as engineers that are contracted out to build
  the best athlete for a country. Therefore the robots are the ones that recieve
  medals, not the students.

### Day 02 - Robot Shotput + Basketball

Description:
  If we don't have enough time to run some soccer games on the first day, we can
  push to the second day and replace shotput.

Learning Objective:
- Learn how to use their robot arm
- Learn how to apply physics to perform better
- Learn to remap controls?

Student Objetive:
- Build a claw / arm attachement
- Learn how to work in a team to score more?

Materials:
- Distance Field
  - towel + tape
- Basketball Court
  - bucket
  - ball

### Day 03 - Auto Robot Track Race

Learning Objectve:
- Learn how to build an autonomous mode using block-based programming
- Learn how to use a simulator

Student Objectve:
- Build a robot that can move a distance then perform a handoff
- Use sensors to stay on-line

Materials:
- Obstacles
  - chairs, tables, boxes, backpacks

Notes:
- Start with a move [x] distance, stop, return within a margin
- Move until bump, then perform arm action to unload
  - allow athletes to trigger the next relay manually but no other controller 
    input
- It could be fun to have an irregular course where students can only run their
  robots in a straight line, so they can decide which legs of the race the robot
  does the handoff in

### Day 04 - Sumo / Wrestling 

Learning Objective:
- Center of gravity
- More advanced autonomous mode
- Learning self-restraint with robots

Student Objective:
- Come up with a sports strategy to defeat your opponent

Materials:
- pool noodle padding

Notes:
- rock paper scissors style auto game?
- manual control?
- allowed to rebuilid their robot?

### Day 05 - Gymnastics / Breakdancing

Learning Objective:
- Create a controlled environment and cater an autonomous performance
- Create a design that appeals to a user-base / crowd
- The crowd judges
- They can pick whatever performance they have, then do the best at it
- They set the challenge
- Can be auto or tele-op
- Can also do paired events

Student Objective:
- Create a fully autonomous performance that is crowd scored

Agenda:
1. Closing ceremony
2. Clean up
