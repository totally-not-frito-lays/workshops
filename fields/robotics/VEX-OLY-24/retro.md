# Retrospective

Overall, the class went well but I had massively overestimated how fast the 
build process would take. Instead of taking the 2 hours that I had spent, it 
took ~5 hours for the first team to finish, ~8 hours for the other 2 teams to
finish their robot. We had a problem of the team that finished first having a 
massive ego-boost and becoming a distraction to others.

We only had the time to compete in one sport, robot soccer, but we had 
auxilliary challenges to teach programming and planning logic.

The biggest challenge that I had in this class was finding something for students
that had finished the primary task at hand to do so that they didn't bother the 
others. Initially I had wanted to ask them to help the other teams but their 
personalities don't mix well with the social dynamics of the other groups which
were already underutilizing their own team. Unless I was actively working with
the students, they would stop whatever challenged I had asked them to do to
horse around or they would achive the minimum then go back to messing around.

## Day 01

Summary:

The first day went well despite realizing that I didn't do a careful inventory 
of what equipment we had. Over half of the students were students that I had 
previously taught across LEGO robotics and creative coding. Interest was high 
in the class (20 / 60 students signed up) but we only had enough robot kits to 
reasonably fit 4 students per robot (12 students in the class).

The problem with the inventory was that we had 4 V5 controller kits, 2 V5 
clawbot kits + expansion packs, and 3 EDR clawbot kits (w/o EDR controller 
kits). What we ended up doing was giving one team a V5 kit + V5 controller, 
then two teams received a EDR kit + V5 controller. The idea was in case there 
was some incompatability with the V5 set, we could pivot to having 2 separate 
teams building out the 2 V5 kits. In hindsight I should've just had them all 
building the same kit and committed to a more equitable field.

We didn't end up doing the opening ceremony because I can get a little socially 
awkward some days and it seemed like the students were happy to be building 
their robots.

To keep their motivation high, I let them drive the demo robot around. In my 
time as a FIRST robotics student, I remember that the driver would need more 
practice in order for the competition to go more smoothly.

Student accomplishments:
- students were attentative and kept each other in check
- students finished their flags
- students are vocal about when they run into problems and ask for help

Instructor wells:
- lots of interest in the class
- lots of returning students in the class
- good resolution to inventory problem
- introduced civil behavior rules
- writing rules in spanish + english
- using a "send up a representative" strategy, it allowed me to give more 
detailed instructions to a few people to then percolate down the other members

Improves:
- improper pre-class inventory check

## Day 02

Summary:

The second day it became more apparent that most teams didn't know how to work 
as a team. There was an emergent leader of each team but the leader of 2 teams 
(had students that explicitly wanted to become engineers) that were taking 
charge of the building process but had 0 delegation ability. The emergent 
leader at one of the groups was chosen because she was the best communicator 
(bi-lingual). There are always plenty of opportunities for this to happen
in any build process but this wasn't facilitated explicitly in the build recipe
that the students were following.

Most teams self-sorted such that at least half of each team discovered that 
there was an onboard servo controller on the main hub. This allowed them to 
get the servos running and stopping early on and potentially presented a 
safety hazard.

Student accomplishments:
- some students started coding

Wells:
- Introduced coding to the teams with a sub-team of each team
- Flag system made it easy to find the right robots
- Introduced safety rules for the robots

Improves:
- Needed to support teams more in parallelizing the build process / working together
- Needed to ask "mechanical leads" to share the building experience more
