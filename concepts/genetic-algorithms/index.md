## About

MLH GHW AI/ML Genetic Algorithms Workshop
- 08.05.2024 -> 08.09.2024
- 2hrs x 1 session
- remote audience streamed on Twitch / YouTube

Theme:
- Lettuce

Materials:

Resources:
- [Whiteboard](https://www.tldraw.com/ro/HXin0o9iUM9Lb_Yu_mdFg?v=837,314,2598,1513&p=page)

Learning Objective:
- introduce genetic algorithms
- apply genetic algorithm to optimize a text-based problem

Constraints:
- assume viewers are seeking to apply the genetic algorithm to a small personal project
- assume viewers can't install a lot of software / rely on complex installation processes
- make sure that the fitness question is a really simple math function
  - think about the solution first
  - solving it genetically neesd to be better than hardcoding
- language?
  - how to translate regular speak into something else
- color?
  - make a rgb color seuquence optimize a color palette?
  - they can make their own fitness functions
- important
  - representation
  - cross-over and mutation
  - selection
  - fitness function

## Schedule

1. Introduce problem
2. Introduce naive solution
3. Introduce GA solution
