<p>Overall, the class went well but I had massively overestimated how fast the
build process would take. Instead of taking the 2 hours that I had spent, it
took ~5 hours for the first team to finish, ~8 hours for the other 2 teams to
finish their robot. We had a problem of the team that finished first having a
massive ego-boost and becoming a distraction to others.</p>
<p>We only had the time to compete in one sport, robot soccer, but we had
auxilliary challenges to teach programming and planning logic.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge that I had in this class was finding something for students
that had finished the primary task at hand to do so that they didn't bother the
others. Initially I had wanted to ask them to help the other teams but their
personalities don't mix well with the social dynamics of the other groups which
were already underutilizing their own team. Unless I was actively working with
the students, they would stop whatever challenged I had asked them to do to
horse around or they would achive the minimum then go back to messing around.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements to the curriculum:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>make the students sign a &quot;engineering contract&quot; treating it like an internship
so that when students become troublesome, it's easier to handle</li>
<li>create a better culture of coopertition by having the teams be more dynamic
<ul>
<li>caveat: since the build process took longer than I expected, it didn't make
sense to remix teams before the robot was built if it would take so long to
modify the physical robot. If we had more time for the summer camp, this might
be the solution.</li>
<li>the culture of coopertition was noticeably absent when asking the that was
finished on day 04 to help the other teams wire their servos.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>make a bigger differentiation between the different roles on the teams and
implement them as &quot;hats&quot; with a rotational program so that they can all
experience the different parts of robotics</li>
<li>create a culture that encourages delegation / distribution of work</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Class demographics:</strong></p>
<p>For clarity, I'll estimate the language fluency of each student of each of the
teams and the prior experience that they had (how many of my previous classes
they've been to).</p>

<h2 id="day-01" tabindex="-1">Day 01 <a class="header-anchor" href="#day-01">#</a></h2>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The first day went well despite realizing that I didn't do a careful inventory
of what equipment we had. Over half of the students were students that I had
previously taught across LEGO robotics and creative coding. Interest was high
in the class (20 / 60 students signed up) but we only had enough robot kits to
reasonably fit 4 students per robot (12 students in the class).</p>
<p>The problem with the inventory was that we had 4 V5 controller kits, 2 V5
clawbot kits + expansion packs, and 3 EDR clawbot kits (w/o EDR controller
kits). What we ended up doing was giving one team a V5 kit + V5 controller,
then two teams received a EDR kit + V5 controller. The idea was in case there
was some incompatability with the V5 set, we could pivot to having 2 separate
teams building out the 2 V5 kits. In hindsight I should've just had them all
building the same kit and committed to a more equitable field.</p>
<ul>
<li>Team 1, 2 used the EDR + V5 controller kits</li>
<li>Team 3 used to V5 kit + V5 controller kit</li>
</ul>
<p>We didn't end up doing the opening ceremony because I can get a little socially
awkward some days and it seemed like the students were happy to be building
their robots.</p>
<p>To incentivize the students to finish building faster, I let them drive the
demo robot around. In my time as a FIRST robotics student, I remember that the
driver would need more practice in order for the competition to go more smoothly.</p>
<p>Student accomplishments:</p>
<ul>
<li>students were attentative and kept each other in check</li>
<li>students finished their flags</li>
<li>students are vocal about when they run into problems and ask for help</li>
</ul>
<p>Instructor wells:</p>
<ul>
<li>lots of interest in the class</li>
<li>lots of returning students in the class</li>
<li>good resolution to inventory problem</li>
<li>introduced civil behavior rules</li>

<h2 id="day-02" tabindex="-1">Day 02 <a class="header-anchor" href="#day-02">#</a></h2>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>By the second day, the social dynamics of each group was much more apparent than
the first day. Most teams self-sorted roles such that at least half of each
team discovered that there was an onboard servo controller on the main hub.
This allowed them to get the servos running and stopping early on and
potentially presented a safety hazard. The other half generally worked on
building out the chassis.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there was still a great deal of novelty in the robotics kits and
there seemed to be ample amounts of work for everybody to do. The goal for this
day was to just build the driver base so that we could start playing
robo-soccer sooner. For the teams with the EDR kits had to make a minor
adjustment to the claw since the claw portion of the EDR kits came fully
assembled with the EDR servo but the EDR servo kit was incompatible with the V5
control hub so we had to swap out the EDR servo.</p>
<p>Since it seemed like most teams were making pretty good pacing, once I
recognized that most teams weren't efficiently utilizing all their
members I decided that it would be a good opportunity to start role
specializations so I grabbed a few volunteers from each team to learn how to
program the robot. <em>Notably I didn't explicitly assign roles to each team, rather
they were emergent or just charactizerizations of what each person did in a team.</em></p>
<p>I was hoping that all teams would finish building their robots by the end of the
day and right after the build process is done, the next step is usually to
program the robot. However, these V5 controller kits already had a few
pre-programmed control schemes so it wasn't necessary to remap the controller.</p>
<p>Instead, I focused on setting autonomous challenges for the students. Rather
than having them follow the built-in tutorials on the vr.vex.com, I set the
following challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the robot from the bottom left corner to the top right corner</li>
<li>Do the same thing but with fewer turns</li>
<li>Move the robot from the top right and then back</li>
</ul>
<p>At this stage, my goal was to teach them how to program so that they could then
teach their teammates how to program and do some role switching later on. This
strategy seemed to have a promising start until the end of the day when I
realize that team 01 had made very little progress. Even though the
documentation they were following was language agnostic, they seemingly fiddled
around with the pieces but didn't meaningfully assemble them. I didn't notice
that since team 02 and team 03 were much more vocal and I was bouncing between
them and the programmers.</p>
<p>Student accomplishments:</p>
<ul>
<li>at least one student from each team started coding</li>
<li>students are still contributing to the robotics chassis</li>
</ul>
<p>Wells:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduced coding to the teams with a sub-team of each team</li>
<li>Flag system made it easy to find the right robots</li>
<li>Introduced safety rules for the robots</li>
</ul>
<p>Improves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Needed to support teams more in parallelizing the build process / working together</li>
<li>Needed to ask &quot;mechanical leads&quot; to share the building experience more</li>
<li>Needed to take more pictures of the programming</li>
<li>Should've challenged students to beat a specific time constraint or &quot;beat my
record&quot; / something to encourage them to drive diagonally</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-03" tabindex="-1">Day 03 <a class="header-anchor" href="#day-03">#</a></h2>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>By day 03, the social dynamics of each group manifested more clearly as the
novelty of the robots wore off and with it, their attention span. Even more
interesting was observing the leadership dynamics form. There was an emergent
leader of each team that was separate from the delegate that I spoke with on
day 01. These were generally students that explicitly wanted to become engineers
but had trouble sharing the building experience with their team members. In
team 01 the leader ended up being the bilingual student which makes sense given
she can actually communicate with the rest of the team.</p>
<p>There are always plenty of opportunities for delegation to occur in any build
process but this wasn't facilitated explicitly in the build recipe that the
students were following. I still haven't figured out a clean way to support
splitting up the different parts of the build process but this is something I'm
looking forward to discovering.</p>
<p>On this day, the first team to finish their robot finished and became a bit of
a menace to the rest of the students. This is where I faced the most personality
problems during the camp as they didn't have a productive way to let out their
energy or the attention span to continue working on the robot. In fact, most
teams at this stage had at least 2 members that would hop on their phones or
straight up nap. I did my best to get them to work on something or give them
a mini-challenge to focus on. Most of Day 03 and Day 04 were spent rotating
around to check-in on the distracted students or helping the focused ones
troubleshoot some physical problems and finding &quot;missing parts.&quot; <em>In hindsight,
it would've been better to incentivize teams to keep themselves on track.</em></p>
<p>I had wanted to do a mini-challenge that the programmers would have to teach /
work with their team for but I was worried about their pacing for finishing
their robots before the competition. At this stage, I was still hoping to
finish the robot soccer by Day 04.</p>
<p>Much to my surprise, a student who had previously been a troublemaker was very
earnestly trying in the programming challenge, despite the perception that the
rest of his team had in him. He was able to succeed in the challenge and
constantly needed my approval. While it's always a heartwarming experience
for any student to succeed in a challenge and genuinely enjoy the problem-
solving experience, in particular, it was especially rewarding to see this
student do so despite the reputation he had previously earned for himself.</p>

<h2 id="day-04" tabindex="-1">Day 04 <a class="header-anchor" href="#day-04">#</a></h2>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>For the most part, day 04 was very similar to day 03, it's just that the
emphasis was on finishing the robots in time for the competition on Day 05.
Particularly troubling was team 03 which had finished their robot first. The
mechanical lead of this team had skipped the &quot;supper&quot; breaks that were an hour
into the class to continue working on the robot which was cool to see but I
advised against it since nutrition and a mental break are key to avoiding burnout
and it seemed like he was romanticizing the &quot;studious engineer&quot; trope.
Unfortunately this led to his pride taking over his personality in the coming
few days.</p>
<p>The way I tried to resolve this was by asking them to work on some autonomous
modes. So I had brought a 6 foot stick and made a quick and dirty challenge
course to challenge them to program their robot to score the goal. This
challenge seemed well scoped for their ability and understanding and should've
encouraged them to try to measure out how far they should move at each distance.
Instead they approached it the naive way of restarting the process from scratch
each time. If the whole class were participating then I would've hinted at the
solution but the extra time helped so that I could work with the other students.
The extension to this challenge was to lift a smaller ball and score a &quot;bucket&quot;
then to score that &quot;bucket&quot; from further away.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/vex-oly-24-arena.png" alt="auto soccer practice"></p>
<p>For the other teams that were struggling with sharing the work, I recommended
students take pictures of instructions a few pages ahead so they could
parallelize the work better.</p>
<p>There was a great deal more shennanigans from the students as they started
throwing around the balls that were meant for the robot to play with. This is
where if I had fostered a culture of coopertition, it would've paid off more.</p>
<p>As the other teams came closer to finishing their robots, it came time to start
wiring up the servos to the control hub. There's a specific way to do this that
isn't detailed in the hub, unless you had the build manual for the V5 kit. So I
had to borrow the kit from the team that had finished and unfortunately, they
were rather sassy responding with something to the effect of &quot;why should I help
my opponents.&quot; I had a lecture that I began working on mentally but thankfully
despite their sassiness they still gave up the wiring diagram.</p>
<p>Teams 01 / 02 were able to finish building their robot and with the extra time
that they had, I tasked them with the same autonomous challenge but they didn't
have enough time to finish the challenge by the end of this day.</p>
<p>Student Accomplishments:</p>

<li>remaining teams finished their build</li>

<h2 id="day-05" tabindex="-1">Day 05 <a class="header-anchor" href="#day-05">#</a></h2>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>On competition day, I started off the day by explicitly setting a hard deadline
for when the competition would start (1 hour in). An important part of
competition day is making sure that batteries and controllers are charged.
The challenge now was balancing driver practice with battery life. While they
were practicing, I invited team 03 to add in support for a vision sensor but
they were being a handful to manage and were expecting a camera feed instead
of a color / range sensor.</p>
<p>Once it was right around game time, we reorganized the room and set up the
arena. Some other classes and students that were not in the class were invited
to spectate the soccer matches!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a member of team 03 behaved in an inappropriate manner and
constantly made offensive gestures and remarks to the stage where he was no
longer listening to my authority. I had to escalate this up to the STEM program
director to speak with him and although he denied this, he eventually stopped.</p>
<p>Originally it was planned to have the director of the after school STEM
activities to pilot the instructor set but one of the teams not only had
a technical bug with the controller being absolutely bricked, they also burned
their battery to 0%. As a result, the instructor robot became the donor robot.</p>
<p>When it came time for the matches, Team 02 dominated the games but completely
burned out their battery as well. Team 01 had the least experience driving but
actually shared the driving opportunity across different members. Team 03 put
up a good fight but couldn't quite match up the finesse of Team 02.</p>
<p>The rules that I had defined were roughly as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>flipping / disabling other bots = penalty shot</li>
<li>first to 3 in 3 minutes, or next to score in over time</li>
<li>no people in the play field</li>
</ol>
<p>In hindsight, I should've had them rotate out their &quot;pilots&quot; after each match
to make sure that they didn't let one pilot hog the controller and to be a bit
more explicit about what kinds of audience participation was available (ie.
for throw-ins or getting the ball out of corners).</p>
<p>In the end the teams were all awarded some faux letter seal stickers take home
or apply to their phone cases. In the case of having multiple events, I would've
preferred to award the medals to robots instead, but since we only had the one
event, I thought it was a reasonable adjustment to award the &quot;engineers +
pilots&quot; of each team instead.</p>
<p>Student Accomplishments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everybody was able to compete and score a goal!</li>
</ul>
<p>Wells:</p>
<ul>
<li>Game was very well attended and had everybody's attention</li>
</ul>
<p>Improves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better handling of disruptive and inappropriate behavior from students</li>
</ul>
