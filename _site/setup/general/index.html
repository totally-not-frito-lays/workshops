<h3>Bitwarden - Password Manager</h3>
<p>Reusing passwords means you have one point of failure for all the accounts
under your name. Using a free password manager allows you to generate passwords
and you don't have to burden yourself with remembering any of the passwords!</p>
<p>I personally recommend using Bitwarden<a href="%5BBitwarden%5D(https://bitwarden.com/)">^2</a> since it's free and open source.</p>
