<h2>About</h2>
<p>Windows is one of the most popular operating systems for consumer-grade laptops
and computers but it can be confusing to set up and install developer tools
on Windows. Especially since many programming tutorials and tools rely on
Linux-based tools.</p>
<p>This document will highlight the developer set up that I have on my own machine.</p>
<h3>WSL - Windows Subsystem for Linux</h3>
<p>I personally recommend installing WSL<a href="%5BWSL%5D(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment)">^1</a> on any windows machine as many
programming tutorials will be easier to follow if you follow the Linux options.
The default distribution this ships with is Ubuntu / Debian.</p>
<p>The Microsoft developer tutorials are a fantastic resource. The following the
minimum tutorials I recommend for novice software engineers / students.</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Best practices for setup
<ul>
<li>you don't need to make it a secure password because the only people that
can access your machine have to get through your computer password first</li>
<li>on a full Linux install this password would be the same as your computer
password</li>
<li>use a password manager if you're afraid of forgetting it<a href="%5BBitwarden%5D(https://bitwarden.com/)">^2</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[ ] Get started with VS Code</li>
<li>[ ] Get started with Git</li>
<li>[ ] Install NodeJS on WSL</li>
<li>[ ] Get started with Linux and Bash</li>
</ul>
