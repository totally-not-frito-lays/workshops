## About

Windows is one of the most popular operating systems for consumer-grade laptops
and computers but it can be confusing to set up and install developer tools
on Windows. Especially since many programming tutorials and tools rely on 
Linux-based tools.

This document will highlight the developer set up that I have on my own machine.

### WSL - Windows Subsystem for Linux

I personally recommend installing WSL[^1] on any windows machine as many 
programming tutorials will be easier to follow if you follow the Linux options. 
The default distribution this ships with is Ubuntu / Debian.

The Microsoft developer tutorials are a fantastic resource. The following the 
minimum tutorials I recommend for novice software engineers / students.

- [ ] Best practices for setup
  - you don't need to make it a secure password because the only people that 
  can access your machine have to get through your computer password first
  - on a full Linux install this password would be the same as your computer 
  password
  - use a password manager if you're afraid of forgetting it[^2]
- [ ] Get started with VS Code
- [ ] Get started with Git
- [ ] Install NodeJS on WSL
- [ ] Get started with Linux and Bash
