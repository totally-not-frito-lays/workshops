# 2025 Monarch Lesson Plan

Moving into 2025, I want to start preparing the students I work with for more of
the school engineering challenges in high school. This means focusing more on
learning first principles / problem-oriented engineering.

Here are a few challenges for high school students
- https://www.nasa.gov/stmd-flight-opportunities/access-flight-tests/techrise/ 
  - high school cubesat hackathon
- https://developer.apple.com/swift-student-challenge/
  - high school apple developer challenge
- https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/
  - high school app challenge for CS
  - requires congressional approval
- https://www.changex.org/us/hour-of-code
  - funding for hour of code activities

## Middle School

- Simple Machines with LEGO SPIKE
- Kickstart a Business Curriculum

## High School

VEX Robotics Lesson Plan:
- could use the old olympics plan now that the robot base has been built

Hackathon Proposal
- no code / low code tools
- robotics at a hackathon
  - logistically risky considering the equipment might not be put away properly
  - logistically tough considering the need for transportation for the event


No Code / Low Code Tools
- MIT App Inventor
- Thunkable
- Adalo
- Notion

No Code / Low Code Structure
- https://www.cmu.edu/roboticsacademy/PDFs/Research/Robot%20Algebra/design-based-learning-units.pdf
  - defining the problem
  - identifying needs
  - decomposing the system
  - brainstorming solutions
  - picking a solution
  - prototyping
  - evaluation
  - iterate and improve
