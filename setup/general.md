### Bitwarden - Password Manager

Reusing passwords means you have one point of failure for all the accounts 
under your name. Using a free password manager allows you to generate passwords
and you don't have to burden yourself with remembering any of the passwords!

I personally recommend using Bitwarden[^2] since it's free and open source.
