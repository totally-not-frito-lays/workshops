## About

There are so many tools and choices out there and when getting started with
development, it's really difficult to make informed choices when you haven't
even gotten your foot in the door.

The recommendations I make here are based on my personal experience and are 
intended as starting points.

This directory is setup with install instructions based on operating systems
for general software engineering with a few tools for each of the branches of 
software engineering I've worked with.
